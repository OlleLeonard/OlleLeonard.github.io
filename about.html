    <h1>About Olle L Mattsson</h1>
    <b>Hey!</b>
<p>
    I am a happy junior Front End developer who is now looking for a new job and exciting opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    I am looking for a job with the opportunity to spread my knowledge and ideas and gather new experiences together with wonderful colleagues.
</p>
<p>
    I am good at Html, Css, Scss, Git, Javascript, etc. and am eager to use my knowledge in professional life.
</p>
<p>
    I already have a bachelor's degree as a teacher in visual arts and after-school teacher and have worked at various schools for about five years.
</p>
<p>
    This has made me good in social contexts where you have to compromise and make quick decisions.
</p>
<p>
    As a work colleague, I often contribute with a light-hearted atmosphere and ideas to develop the business.
</p>
<p>
    After several years of professional experience in school, I have now started to rethink and have come to the conclusion that I want to work with IT as I want to do something I find great joy in.
</p>
<p>
    I have read courses in Front End development as well as lots of self-study and now feel that I am ready to contribute my skills at your workplace.
</p>
<br>
<b>I look forward to hearing from you!</b>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<h3>Olle Mattsson</h3>
